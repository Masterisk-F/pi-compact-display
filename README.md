# pi-compact-display

An extension for the Pi Assistant that allows you to finely customize the terminal (TUI) output for various tools (e.g., bash, read, ls, edit) on a per-tool basis.

It helps keep your context and screen clean by limiting overly long tool outputs or hiding unnecessary tool calls, summarizing them instead.

## Features

- **Per-Tool Configuration**: Set different display modes for each tool.
- **Summary Display**: Hide execution details and output only a summary like `⚡ read(1) ls(2)` at the top of the assistant's response.
- **Line Limit & Padding Removal**: Limit the number of output lines and automatically strip empty padding lines.
- **Grouped Tool Results**: With `grouping` enabled, all `lines`-mode calls in one turn are combined into a single tool card (e.g. `⚡ bash ×3` + each command/output).
- **Support for External Tools**: Override the display settings not only for Pi's built-in tools but also for any custom tools added by other extensions.
- **Expandable Details**: Fully supports Pi's native expand feature (e.g., pressing `Ctrl+O` in the TUI), overriding the limits to show the full output.

pi install .
```

## Configuration

Create a configuration file named `config.json` at the following location:

**File Path:**
`~/.pi/agent/extensions/pi-compact-display/config.json`

### Configuration Structure

The configuration is in JSON format, where the key is the "tool name" and the value is its "display settings (options)".

```json
{
  "tool_name": {
    "mode": "display_mode",
    "outputLines": number,
    "noPadding": true or false
  }
}
```

### Available Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`mode`** | `string` | The display mode for the tool. Must be `"count_only"`, `"lines"`, or `"default"`. (Required) |
| **`outputLines`** | `number` | The maximum number of lines to display. Only effective when `mode` is `"lines"`. (Optional) |
| **`noPadding`** | `boolean` | Whether to remove leading, trailing, and consecutive empty lines from the output. Set to `true` to omit empty lines. Only effective when `mode` is `"lines"`. (Optional) |

### Display Modes (`mode`)

1. **`"count_only"`**
   - **Behavior**: The tool execution and its output are completely hidden from the screen. Instead, the number of executions is summarized at the top of the assistant's message (e.g., `⚡ read(1)`).
   - **Use Case**: Best for tools like `read`, `ls`, `find`, or `grep`, where the LLM gathers information autonomously and humans do not need to read the raw output.

2. **`"lines"`**
   - **Behavior**: Displays the tool execution command and a truncated portion of its result. It limits the output to the specified `outputLines`.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for tools like `bash`, `edit`, or `write`, where humans want to quickly check the executed command and whether it resulted in an error.

3. **`"default"`**
   - **Behavior**: Bypasses this extension's rendering overrides and falls back to Pi's default rendering logic (or logic defined by other extensions).
   - **Note**: Any tool not specified in the configuration file, or if `config.json` is missing entirely, will automatically default to `default`.

### Example Configuration

```json
{
  "grouping": true,
  "user": {
    "noPadding": true
  },
  "read": { "mode": "count_only" },
  "ls": { "mode": "count_only" },
  "find": { "mode": "count_only" },
  "grep": { "mode": "count_only" },
  
  "bash": { 
    "mode": "lines", 
    "outputLines": 3, 
    "noPadding": true 
  },
  "write": { 
    "mode": "lines", 
    "outputLines": 1, 
    "noPadding": true 
  },
  
  "mcp:tavily_tavily_search": { "mode": "count_only" },
  "mcp:list": { "mode": "lines", "outputLines": 10 },
  "mcp": { "mode": "default" },
  "default": { "mode": "count_only" },

  "my_custom_tool": {
    "mode": "count_only"
  }
}
```

*Note: You can specify any tool name, including custom tools added by other extensions like `my_custom_tool`.*

### Sub-tool and Action-Specific Configuration (Gateway Tools like MCP)

For "gateway tools" that call other tools or actions internally (such as the `mcp` tool), you can configure them specifically based on their arguments (like `tool` or `action`).

The configuration priority is evaluated in a cascading fallback:
**Specific Sub-tool Configuration > General Tool Configuration > `default` Key Configuration > System Default**.
This mechanism applies to all tools, not just MCP.

**Example for MCP tools:**
- **`mcp:<tool_name>`**: When a specific MCP tool is called (e.g., `"mcp:tavily_tavily_search": { "mode": "count_only" }`).
- **`mcp:list`**: When listing available tools on a server (e.g., `"mcp:list": { "mode": "lines", "outputLines": 10 }`).
- **`mcp:connect`**: When connecting to a server.
- **`mcp`**: The general fallback for MCP calls that don't match any specific configuration.

*Note: The same priority (`specific setting > "default" setting`) applies to built-in tools like `read` and `bash` as well.*

### User Prompt Padding Configuration

If you want to remove the vertical empty lines (vertical padding) that appear above and below the prompt messages you enter, you can configure them specifically using the `"user"` key. This configuration is not affected by other configurations like `"default"` and is only applied if explicitly defined.

**Configuration Example:**
```json
{
  "user": {
    "noPadding": true
  }
}
```

- **`noPadding`** (`boolean`): Set to `true` to remove the empty lines (padding) inserted above and below your prompt input, making the UI extremely compact.

### Global Setting: Grouping Tool Results (`grouping`)

`lines`-mode tools normally render one tool card per call. When this is enabled, **all `lines`-mode calls within one assistant turn are combined into a single tool card**, greatly reducing the vertical space used on screen.

**Configuration Example:**
```json
{
  "grouping": true,
  "bash": { "mode": "lines", "outputLines": 3, "noPadding": true },
  "write": { "mode": "lines", "outputLines": 1 }
}
```

- **`grouping`** (`boolean`): Set to `true` to combine all `lines`-mode calls in one turn (regardless of tool name) into a single card. A count header such as `⚡ bash ×3 edit ×1` is shown at the top of the card (only when 2+ calls are combined). Like `"user"`, this setting is not affected by other configurations such as `"default"` and is only applied if explicitly defined.
- Each call's command line and output (truncated per that tool's own `outputLines`) are listed in call order.
- Even when combined, you can press `Ctrl+O` (expand) to view the full output of every call.
- Calls in different turns (separated by a user message) are rendered as separate cards.

## Usage & Shortcuts

After setting up the configuration, simply start the Pi assistant.

- **Context Cleanup**: Tools set to `count_only` will display summaries like `⚡ read(1)` on the screen. However, this summary text is automatically stripped from the conversation history (context) sent to the LLM behind the scenes, so it won't pollute the LLM's context window.
- **Full Output (Expanded)**: If the output is truncated in `lines` mode, you can use Pi's native expand shortcut (typically `Ctrl+O`) to bypass the line limits and view the full output.
